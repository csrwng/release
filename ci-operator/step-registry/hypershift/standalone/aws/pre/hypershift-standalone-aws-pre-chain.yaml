    The HyperShift standalone AWS pre-setup step contains all steps that provision 
    an OpenShift cluster with fixed AWS region and zones using custom AWS credentials.
    
    This chain skips IAM user creation since it assumes custom AWS credentials are provided.
    It uses fixed region and zone configuration instead of dynamic resource leasing.

  documentation: |-
    The HyperShift aws reqserving e2e workflow executes tests against a standalone
    OCP cluster with fixed AWS region and zones using custom AWS credentials.
    Administrative access to the control plane is provided via the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

    This workflow uses the hypershift-standalone-aws-pre chain which allows:
    - Fixed AWS region and zone specification via FIXED_AWS_REGION and FIXED_AWS_ZONES
    - Custom AWS credentials support via STANDALONE_AWS_CREDS_FILE
    - Guaranteed zone allocation (no dynamic resource leasing dependencies)

    For now, please direct all questions and comments to:

    - Seth Jennings (sjenning@redhat.com)
    - Cesar Wong (cewong@redhat.com)
